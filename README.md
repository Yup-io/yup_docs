# Getting Started

## Overview

Yup is a network that rewards you for good opinions. It creates a social consensus layer for the Internet, accurately representing the social value of **anything,** from random Tweets to rare NFTs. It does this through the Yup Protocol, a decentralized, semi-autonomous social consensus protocol. The Yup Protocol determines the social value of content and rewards users for creating and curating it. ([Learn More](protocol.md))

The best way to use Yup is the Yup Web Extension, a browser plug-in that allows you to rate any website or piece of content. It also stores your YUP tokens and displays the social value of everything in our color-coded scheme. ([Learn More](ext.md))

## Simple Start

Start by signing in with Twitter on the [Yup site](https://yup.io)

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ Youâ€™re now earning money and clout based on your Twitter activity.
