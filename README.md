### Overview

Yup is a network that rewards you for good opinions. By doing so, it creates a social consensus layer for the internet, accurately representing the agreed-upon social value of **anything**, from random Tweets to your history professor. It does this by interacting with the Yup Protocol, which is a decentralized semi-autonomous social consensus protocol that determines the rewards and social value of all content based on users' interactions with it.

The best way to use Yup is through the Yup Web Extension, a browser plug-in that allows you to vote on any site or piece of content across the web. It also stores your money and displays the social value of everything in a color coded scheme. ( [Learn More](/ext.md) )
