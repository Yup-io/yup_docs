# Guidelines (WIP)

> This guideline is a frame of reference and doesn't constitute any liability on behalf of Yup or its team. It's meant as a draft of values and policies of the organization.

1. **Glossary**
   1. "Yup" - [Yup.io](http://yup.io) inc
   2. "Account" - refers to the EOS account and Yup account created when signing up to Yup
   3. "Yup Protocol" - refers to the Yup Protocol and the smart contracts that make up the protocol
   4. "Collusion" - When multiple users coordinate to boost each other's content or someone else's
   5. "Sock Puppet" - When an entity creates multiple accounts and boosts those accounts or another account
2. **Guidelines**
   1. Anyone is allowed to apply to create a Yup account, and we encourage you to do so.
   2. Users can create / interact with the Yup Protocol directly from the Ethereum and EOS blockchains.
   3. However, to protect the protocol and the resources we use to create Yup accounts, we reserve the right to blacklist any account created through the Yup app at our discretion.
      * To prevent your account from being blacklisted/banned:
        * Don't use bots
        * Don't be a sock puppet
        * Don't collude
        * Don't harass or offend other accounts
   4. Anyone is allowed to use the Yup protocol.
      * Although we reserve the right to ban accounts at our discretion, anyone can interact with smart contracts in the protocol using an EOS compatible wallet such as Scatter.
   5. If you feel that your account was blacklisted by mistake, submit a re-evaluation request here: [https://yupio.typeform.com/to/MAF4Rhfy](https://yupio.typeform.com/to/MAF4Rhfy)
3. **Privacy**
   1. Yup collects the following:
      1.  Personally identifiable information

          For example: name, address, email address, age, or identification number
      2.  Authentication information

          For example: passwords, credentials, security question, or personal identification number (PIN)
   2. Your data will never:
      * be sold to third parties

4. **Decentralization**
   1. We are committed to full decentralization and community on all fronts, putting the protocol and token over the team or its individuals. This will be a work in progress for a long time, but is our focus and commitment.
