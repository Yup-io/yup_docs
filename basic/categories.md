# Categories

## Categories

Rating categories are pre-set adjectives (smart, popular, funny) which express an opinion about content. The 1-5 scale expresses the strength of that opinion.

_For example, if you find a video entertaining, you can rate it 4/5 in the "like" category. If you also think it's stupid, you can rate it 2/5 in the "smart" category._

Users only receive rewards when others rate in the same category with the same sentiment (positive or negative). If you think something is smart, you only get rewarded if others do too, not if they think itâ€™s funny.

### Why Categories Matter

Part of our mission to improve opinion-sharing is to add nuance. Oversimplification is one of the most frustrating and divisive aspect of the Internet. It is important to accurately represent social value _within a specific field_. Marylin Monroe was more popular than Albert Einstein. But Einstein was surely smarter, and Charlie Chaplin was funnier than both! An architect's opinion on food should not be trusted as much as a chef, just as you would not trust a chef to evaluate a building. This is why we distribute influence evenly and weight opinions separately.

Over time, we expect to add categories, allowing people to express their opinion more accurately and earn influence in specific fields of expertise. If you think we are missing a category, [let us know](mailto:community@yup.io)!
