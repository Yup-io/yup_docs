# Yup Score

On-chain reputation is extremely valuable, but hard to measure. Currently, protocols, DAOs, and individuals have no universal signal to understand a user's social value. This leads to bot activity, high-friction onboarding, and lack of clarity for individuals about their impact. We need an easy to use, universal standard of uniqueness for addresses that provides sybil resistance and an accurate measurement of social value.

The Yup Score provides a reputation metric for every EVM/Ethereum address by aggregating their on-chain actions and ranking them between 1-100. The weight of each action is determined by its social value.
