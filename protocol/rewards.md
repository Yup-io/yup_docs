# YUP Rewards

## How to earn YUP

Users can make money by receiving YUP tokens as rewards for curating and/or providing [liquidity](https://medium.com/cardwallet/providing-liquidity-what-does-it-mean-and-how-does-it-work-2a0ad0ea2a2d).

### **Create or Curate to Earn**

The Yup [protocol ](../protocol.md)determines the monetary value of each post/link and vote (like) tied to that post/link based on each voter's [influence](https://docs.yup.io/#/protocol?id=influence). For example, if 100 [YUP](https://github.com/Yup-io/yup\_docs/tree/24938ac610bbd465109806ec69fb9e97054f2399/token.md) is being distributed in 1 hour and your like's value makes up 5% of all vote value in that 1 hour, your like is worth 5 YUP. Yup then rewards that money to all previous users who liked the same as you AND rewards the creator of the content.

**Vote Value (likes)**

When content is liked, approximately 50% of rewards are given to its creator (if one exists). The rest is split between previous raters in proportion to their influence.

#### The Process

1. Alice creates content (a post, for example)
2. Bob likes the content.
3. Then Carol also likes the same content.
4. Alice receives the token value of Bob's like.
5. Alice and Bob share in the token value of Carol's like.
6. And so on! The more likes that agree with you, the more you earn.

**Not every opinion earns rewards.** Your opinion doesn’t make you money simply because you expressed it. It’s only worth something _if others agree_. If nobody rates the same as you, it means you’re late or your opinion is unpopular, so it does not merit rewards.

#### Measuring Influence

Your [influence](https://docs.yup.io/#/protocol?id=influence) (IN) is a measure of social value on Yup. Influence is calculated from your YUP token holdings and rewards previously received. As the Yup Protocol evolves, additional factors will affect your influence score.

### **Liquidity Providing**

**Base**

To maximize flexibility in depositing, withdrawing, and providing liquidity for YUP, we've opened a YUP-ETH liquidity pool on Base.Let’s start with the first two factors.If you're an active LP -- Base's lower fees allows you to add and withdraw liquidity easily due to the chain's lower fees while earning LP rewards_As always, this is not financial advice. Just giving you the lay of the land, kind stranger._Providing Liquidity on Base_Pre-requisite_\


* Have some ETH on Base for providing liquidity.

1. Acquire YUP on Base by crossposting via the Yup app or purchasing some on Uniswap
2. If you have YUP and ETH on Base, go to the YUP-ETH LP pool on Uniswap.
3. Input an equal value of YUP and ETH in the pool and collect your YUP-ETH Uniswap LP token.
4. Go to [app.yup.io/staking](http://app.yup.io/staking), select the Uniswap on Base staking pool and enjoy life as a humble YUP farmer.
