# Yup Extension

[Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yup/nhmeoaahigiljjdkoagafdccikgojjoi)

Yup is a network that rewards you for quality opinions. Its goal is to create a social consensus layer on the internet, accurately representing the agreed-upon social value of anything, from random Tweets to your history professor. Yup then rewards its users proportional to the social value of their contributions. With the Yup extension, you can earn rewards as you regularly browse the internet. All you have to do is rate through the extension, or directly on Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, or Google Maps. The technology is complicated, but how it works is simple.

 The Extension is a browser plug-in that rewards users' opinions across the web.

The Yup Web Extension is a web browser plug-in that gives you the ability to express your opinion on any site on the internet. You can do so by rating on a scale of 1-5 in categories such as ‘popular’, ‘smart’, ‘funny’. When other users give the same opinion on the same content, you earn YUP and influence! On the Yup network, not all ratings are created equal. [Learn more](rating.md)

 On certain sites, information and Yup functions are overlaid for better use.

The extension functions as both a tool for Yup-related actions and a crypto account. You can use it by clicking on the extension itself or by using overlaid buttons on certain sites. Additionally, you can use traditional reactions \(i.e. Twitter likes, Reddit upvotes, Gmaps ratings\) and they’ll be treated as a Yup rating too!

YUP tokens can be sent to friends and other accounts. But don't send them all! They help build Influence, which can earn you more rewards in the future.
